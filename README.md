## 🧾 Project Explanation

The **Student Management System** is a basic web application developed using **Java (JSP & Servlets)**, **HTML/CSS**, and **MySQL**. It allows administrators to manage student records in a database through a web interface. This project is ideal for learning **full-stack Java web development** using the traditional JSP/Servlet model.

---

### 🎯 Purpose

This project serves as an entry-level CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for:

- Practicing JSP and Servlet integration.
- Understanding JDBC database connectivity.
- Demonstrating how HTML forms interact with backend Java logic.
- Learning how to deploy a dynamic Java web app using Apache Tomcat.

---

### 🧠 How It Works

1. **Frontend (HTML/CSS + JSP)**  
   - Users interact with a form to add students.
   - The student list is displayed in a table.
   - Delete buttons remove student records from the database.

2. **Backend (Java + JSP logic)**  
   - Java code embedded in the JSP handles form submission, SQL queries, and rendering output.
   - JDBC is used to connect to the MySQL database and execute queries.

3. **Database (MySQL)**  
   - Stores student records: `id`, `name`, `email`, and `course`.
   - Uses simple SQL queries for CRUD operations.

### 📌 Highlights

- 🛠️ Full-stack Java-based application (JSP + JDBC)
- 🗃️ MySQL integration for persistent storage
- 🎨 Basic styling using CSS for user-friendly UI
- 🧩 One-file implementation for quick deployment

---

### ⚠️ Note

This version uses **embedded Java in JSP** for simplicity and learning. For professional projects, it's recommended to follow **MVC architecture** (Model-View-Controller) using:

- Servlets for controller logic
- JSP for views only
- Java classes for models and DB operations
